# Project Description
"This project aims to scrape and aggregate ""crowd-sourced"" (collected by different volunteer groups) survey data collected by http://coastalcleanup.nus.edu.sg and show the distribution of marine debris found at various beach sites over the years, in terms of the types of marine debris and geographical locations of the clean-up sites. Currently, the site displays individual site reports and yearly consolidated reports, but lacks an overall consolidated view of the trends over the years which will be useful to derive insights from the data (e.g. whether the situation is improving over the years).
